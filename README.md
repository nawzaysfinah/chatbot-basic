# 🤖 chatbot-basic -> AI-Powered Chatbot

## 📖 Overview

This project showcases a basic AI chatbot leveraging the power of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API. What makes this project unique is that it was programmed exclusively using another AI assistant, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

## 🌟 Features

- 💬 Interactive chat interface
- 🧠 Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- 🔄 Real-time streaming responses
- 🧹 Chat history management

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web interface
- [Google GenerativeAI](https://ai.google.dev/) for the Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language

## 🤔 How It Works

1. The user enters a message in the chat interface.
2. The message is sent to the Gemini 1.5 Flash API.
3. The API generates a response, which is streamed back to the user in real-time.
4. The chat history is maintained for context in future interactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```

   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
